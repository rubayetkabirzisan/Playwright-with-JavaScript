// Introduction to Playwright
// Cypress vs Playwright

// Playwright is an open-source test automation library developed by Microsoft. It is designed for end-to-end testing of web applications and supports multiple browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Playwright provides a powerful API for interacting with web pages, allowing developers to write tests that can simulate user interactions, navigate through pages, and verify content.
// Cypress, on the other hand, is another popular end-to-end testing framework that is known for its ease of use and developer-friendly features. It runs directly in the browser, providing a more interactive experience for writing and debugging tests. Cypress has a rich set of built-in commands and assertions, making it easy to get started with testing web applications.
// Here are some key differences between Playwright and Cypress:
// 1. Browser Support: Playwright supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), while Cypress primarily supports Chromium-based browsers.
// 2. Architecture: Playwright runs tests outside the browser, while Cypress runs tests directly in the browser, providing a more interactive experience.
// 3. Network Interception: Both frameworks support network interception, but Playwright offers more advanced capabilities for modifying requests and responses.
// 4. Parallel Execution: Playwright has built-in support for parallel test execution, while Cypress requires additional setup for parallelization.
// 5. Community and Ecosystem: Cypress has a larger community and a more extensive ecosystem of plugins and integrations compared to Playwright.
// Overall, both Playwright and Cypress are powerful tools for end-to-end testing, and the choice between them often depends on specific project requirements and developer preferences.
